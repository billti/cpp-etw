# cpp-etw

This repo demonstrates how to log manifest-free ETW events using only the Win32
APIs and C++, and without the `TraceLoggingProvider.h` header file, which uses
a large number of macros, and various pragmas, declspecs, etc. which may not
work correctly on different compilers.

The `manifest-free` ETW mechanism consists of using ETW channel 11 to log the
events, and providing a couple of additional data descriptors to describe the
event metadata. (One for the provider info, and one for the event layout).

This metadata must be tightly packed in a specific format, which is
the purpose of the `constexpr` templates in `etw-metadata.h`. This allows for
the declaring of the event metadata (the event name, followed by the field
names and types), using a `constexpr` such as the below:

```cpp
constexpr static auto event_meta = EventMetadata("myEventName",
    Field("MyIntVal", kTypeInt32),
    Field("MyMsg", kTypeAnsiStr),
    Field("Address", kTypePointer));
```

The event descriptor, to describe the event id, severity level, flags, etc.
is declared similarly:

```cpp
constexpr static auto event_desc =
    EventDescriptor(102, kLevelInfo, 0 /*keyword*/, kOpCodeStart);
```

The logging of the event uses a variadic template function, with the field
values simply provided in order after the metadata. Thus an entire logging
function in a provider class would appear something like the below:

```cpp
void MyProvider::Log3Fields(INT32 val, const std::string& msg, void* addr) {
  constexpr static auto event_desc = EventDescriptor(100, kLevelVerbose);
  constexpr static auto event_meta = EventMetadata("myEventName",
    Field("MyIntVal", kTypeInt32),
    Field("MyMsg", kTypeAnsiStr),
    Field("Address", kTypePointer));

  LogEventData(&event_desc, &event_meta, val, msg, addr);
}
```

As the first 2 lines are `constexpr` variables, these result in no runtime code
and are evaluated entirely at compile time.

The code in `etw-events.h` declares the `EtwEvents` class, which your provider
should derive from. See the example implementation in the `v8-etw.*` files. The
`v8-etw.cc` file also shows code to ensure only a single instance of the ETW
provider is instantiated. (It does not demonstrate unregistering currently).

The `main.cc` file shows running a simple experiment for measuring perf impact.

Comments near the top of `v8-etw.h` indicate how to start/stop a simple trace
from the command line.

## Building
This project builds using CMake and the Windows SDK. By default the build uses
Clang (see `CMakeLists.txt` in the root).

To build to the `out/build` directory run the following (from the project root):

```cmd
mkdir out\build
cd out\build
cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo ../..
cmake --build -v .
```

## Implementation notes

- Using only `constexpr auto...` and not `static constexpr auto...` inside
  functions results in a large amount of assembly in the function to push
  a representation of the constant data onto the stack. Using `static` results
  in this data being in the read-only segment, with the function simply
  referencing it - which is much cheaper. (This is true of MSVC at least).
- Enabling tracing of the provider on my Surface Book 2 laptop with a CPU and
  memory bound process, logging around 10,000 ETW events/sec, resulted in
  about a 3 percent increase in execution time. (Impact was not observable if
  there was no session recording the events).
- Even logging 3 fields plus metadata (as per the `Log3Fields` function shown
  above), which also checks if the provider is enabled first, only added 44
  assembly instructions inline into the instrumented function, none of which
  were loops or calls. Most of this was to prepare the data descriptors for
  the event instance specific data for `EventWrite`, which seems unavoidable.
  If the provider is not enabled (likely most of the time), only 2 to 4
  assembly instructions are executed before jumping over the rest of the
  event logging code.
- By implementing the bulk of the code in header files, it will generally be
  implemented inline in the function where the logging calls are made. By using
  the [`__builtin_expect`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7346929/what-is-the-advantage-of-gccs-builtin-expect-in-if-else-statements)
  GCC/Clang built-in, where the check is made if the provider is enabled, the
  bulk of the tracing code is placed at the end of the function, and in the usual
  case of the provider not being enabled, no branch is taken, and the tracing
  instructions may not even be fetched into the instruction cache to execute,
  resulting in even lower overhead.

## TODO

- Not all field data types have been implemented yet.
- Add support for activities.
- Add support for unregistering the provider.
